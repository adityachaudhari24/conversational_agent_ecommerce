Keep in mind (for reference) my previous iPhone was an iPhone 6plus that wouldn't last more than 15 minutes without dying. So if you have a really old phone like I did, this company will hook you up with a nice phone for a reasonable price. I've been using this XR for 2 months now and the quality has not changed one bit. I understand some people may experience worse but better yet you may get a phone with over 90% capacity left, it's almost a gamble! But they guarantee over 80% so trust them.

As it turned out, it arrived in perfect, like-new condition. No observable defects, no observable wear/scratches/scuffs even when looking closely, not at arms length as Amazon mentions.<br /><br />Using the iOS battery health app, the battery health was at 100% when I received it. Amazon advertises that the phone will arrive with at least 80% battery health. To check, go to Settings > Battery > Battery Health and then look at Maximum Capacity. If it shows up in problematic condition, Amazon covers it with a generous 90 day return policy. I suspect that the one I received was an 'instant regret' purchase by the original owner and returned immediately. It seems likely that most 'renewed' phones will have some battery degradation so expecting battery health to be at 100% is unrealistic.<br /><br />The only issue I had was not related to this phone. Call sound quality wasn't good and drop outs. After doing a network reset, that was fixed. Go to Settings > General > Transfer or Reset iPhone > Reset Network Settings > enter your passcode and then Reset Network Settings (red letters). Your phone will reboot. You'll have to log on to your wifi network again and if you have a VPN, you may have to set that up again. After doing this, no drop outs and good sound quality. Note that the network reset process changed after the iOS 15 update. Going forward, the sequence above may change again.<br /><br />Amazon's refurb department did a great job of cleaning, wiping the previous installation of iOS and repackaging it. Regardless, I did a complete reset before restoring from a backup. This probably isn't necessary but it brought some peace of mind knowing that It was a clean installation of iOS.<br /><br />It arrived in a well designed aftermarket box designed for cell phones, an Apple charger, Apple cable and an aftermarket screen protector of the type used for shipping protection. They mention that it may come with an aftermarket charger and cable so don't expect Apple branded accessories.<br /><br />Presumably most people purchasing the iPhone 12 Mini will have informed themselves of the pros and cons of this model (ahem..battery life). I'd guess that most will not find battery life to be an issue. For heavy users and for those that regularly use high drain features such as GPS navigation, it would be advisable to have charging capability in the car and at work.<br /><br />The only thing I'd add is that if you want the leather MagSafe case from Apple, keep an eye on prices. It usually sells for 60 dollars but the black one was on sale in Amazon at the time of this writing for 23.99 + tax. Instant purchase and on the way.<br /><br />I used an Apple leather case with an iPhone 8. I was satisfied with its basic protection, feel and handling. Its unlikely to provide as much drop protection as an Incipio Duo and other cases designed with drop protection in mind but 23.99 + tax was hard to pass up.<br /><br />Happy customer, solid purchase for an unlocked iPhone."

She’s in her 80s so simplicity was key. This phone was simple for her to use. She loves it and hasn’t had any issues with it so far. Phone was in perfect pristine condition. Only draw was the battery capacity was at 88% which isn’t bad by any means and I knew the phone was renewed but that really was the only minor drawback. Again not really a big deal. Everything works at it should. Also comes with a screen protector on it so if you’re prone to dropping phones buy an extra pack if not then you’re good to go.

I didn't want to spend a bunch of money because I had just paid off my Samsung mistake, so got one of these. The last iPhone I had before the switch was the iPhone 11 and this SE is just as good. The only thing you're missing is the utra-wide angle lens but it still takes amazing photos and videos. I like having the home button and the small lightweight size is also nice. 128gb is great for recording videos and overall I'm very happy. The battery health on mine when received is 86%, which is within the range of a used 2 year old phone, and I've had no trouble making it though a whole day of normal use. In fact the battery is still better than my newer Samsung Z flip I'm switching back from.<br />Anyway, if you made a similar mistake as me, this is a great cheap way to come back to the best phones."

I payed for a premium renewed and was disappointed that it came at 93% maximum capacity THEN IT DROPPED TO 88% after a few days of use and installs. What? With almost no scratches or dings on the body but come on...something doesn't seem right. If this helps with accountability, the phone tester was MM. I will probably keep and pay the $69 at Apple to replace the battery if it comes to it.

He said he was going to send me a follow up email so I could track the progress of the investigation and he never did.

I took it to a technician who trouble shot it for two days and said he couldn't get it powered back up no matter what he did and believed the motherboard was bad.  I guess i got what i paid for.... someone else's problem."

The listing also stated free shipping with free returns. It never mentioned that I would be dealing with a reseller. It said sold by the Amazon renewed store. I had no intentions of returning the phone until I found out it was defective. The listing also claimed the phone as a tmobile US phone which I doubt since the tmobile app shows this to be yellow in color.<br />Now I’m informed that I have to deal with a reseller who requires the original box it came in when I bought it over two weeks ago.

I dropped my phone last week and it was immediately evident that the back camera was no longer working.  When I took it to a very reputable iPhone repair shop the tech opened up the camera for the first time since purchase and found that all the retention plates that hold the important part of the phone securely in place were missing, such that several components,  apparently including the camera, were dangling by their connections.  He  quickly determined that the camera connector was also damaged beyond repair and the camera  would never work again. The tech told me that this lack of restraint almost certainly contributed to the severity of the damage and , had the missing plates been present, it was likely a repair could have been accomplished.  I'm hoping that this shoddy refurbishment was  just the work of one incompetent or lazy individual and isn't  typical  of the ""renewals"" done by this seller  Either way, I can't recommend anyone else purchase a phone ""renewed"" by this seller."

I had my cousin who works for Apple check out the phone initially, and he said it seemed legitimately refurbished  (it was not opened up). I had some minor problems, such as applications crashing that were not crashing on my iPhone 5 running the same iOS, along with some minor issues, such as the screen randomly going half dark with all movement, including on default applications. Once again, I pulled out my iPhone 5, and the issue was specific to my phone. Fast forward to June of 2018. My phone fell out of my pocket onto concrete with a case on it, and the screen fell out of the phone. When I got it repaired (at a battery repair shop), they told me the parts were all Apple certified inside, BUT it was missing the vibration mechanism, along with most of the screws that hold in the screen, along with several screws inside. They said that it should be fine, however, I also got the battery replaced, although they recommended a new phone since iPhone 6 was having battery issues at the time (this place only sold batteries, lights, and did phone and tablet repair). Before all of this happened, my phone was dropping calls and losing service constantly. I just thought that it was when I called somebody with an Android, but it began happening more and more. Then my phone was only connecting to Verizon sometimes. I got no service in my house, and it was not a service issue as everyone else in my household, and my other friends with Verizon got service. I took it into Verizon, and the guy said that there was a rattling in my phone. He told me the calls could be a software issue, however, I think that it was the phone. He told me that he was surprise that it lasted that long, which was the general impression I had been getting whenever I went to Verizon. Moral of the story: DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER UNLESS YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A TEMPORARY PHONE!!!!!"

I never realized how small it really was until I upgraded. I absolutely love my new phone. There are so many new features that the 5s doesn't have! The 6s Plus can use 3D Touch which I find quicker to use, if you hold down the keyboard it allows you to edit text faster. It even has it where if you double tap on the home button it'll bring the screen down so that you're not constantly reaching up. I like all of these features a lot. Before I got this phone I did as much research as possible. A lot of people said that going from the iPhone 5s to the iPhone 6s Plus was too much of a change because of the large screen, and they couldn't handle it. I feel the exact opposite. This was exactly what I had been looking for for a long time. I know that I'm really going to love this iPhone for a long time. I might even just keep it past my upgrade time."

Came in a small, dirty box with some weird charger. Had obvious scratches on the screen, and the pictures taken with the camera was noticeably worse quality. I had been waiting for 3 weeks to replace my phone so I gave it a shot anyway... the microphone did not work at all. When people called, I could hear them and they couldn't hear me- which I had this misfortune of finding out while needing roadside service from AAA, who hung up on me upon my ""lack"" of response when I answered the phone. Took it to T Mobile and chatted online with Apple to do some troubleshooting- turns out it's just a bad refurbished phone, so the only answer was to return it. Disappointed overall- good luck with your order...<br /><br />12/2/2019<br />Increasing my review from 2 stars to 3 stars. Still leaving off one star for the 1 busted up phone, and 1 star for the inconvenience and 3 weeks of waiting to replace my phone- as well as both times the shipping delayed, (however only by 1 day each time, but I think I should mention it since it is listed ""Prime FREE Delivery""). I ordered a third phone with my fingers crossed and as a last attempt to try out this phone. THANK GOODNESS IT PAID OFF. I got another phone, quality as good as the first one.

It worked good enough most of the time but it seem to always give me some problems. Of course after the warranty was up the real problem started and if I would be out walking in 40° weather my screen would not respond at all. I tried putting on a new screen protector thinking that would help and saw that the edge of my screen was broken.

Woot experience,"I have to preface the review by saying that I was skeptical when making this purchase because of the mixed reviews. But I did my due diligence on different sellers selling renewed devices and  chose Woot as the seller. I had good experience with Woot when I directly purchased from them in the past.  Amazon Renewed Guarantee provide additional reassurance if something did not go well. (but there's always a catch.. more on that at the end).<br /><br />Product Delivery/Packaging: Very poor<br />1. The product was not eligible for prime for some reason.<br />2. The delivery took more than week but was delivered as committed.<br />3. The phone was packed in Bubble Envelope ...not an Iphone box or any box but just yellow bubble envelope.<br />4. The phone was wrapped in foam cover and then bubble wrap (see picture). Was really surprised the phone survived the transit. Kudos to UPS who handled this with such care<br /><br />Phone and Accessories: Average<br />1. Phone itself was wrapped up in plastic cover and looked almost good, with very lil signs of wear and tear<br />2. Battery was at 86% capacity which again was very disappointing and am not sure how it will hold up over time. I will update this review after using the phone for a few days<br />3. The accessories included were more of joke. Yes, technically there was a charger and a charging cable. I say technically since charger was not an OEM charger and the cable would not reach from outlet to the phone. It was barely 6 inches long. No thats not a typo but it was not even 6 inches.<br /><br />Just Phone: Good<br />(This is not a review of an iPhone XS itself, but the renewed phone delivered)<br />1.  As mentioned above the physical condition of the phone was good. There were very few signs of wear and tear<br />2. It was ATT Model A1920 (MT8X2LL/A), fully unlocked with both GSM/CDMA Support<br />3. I was able to register my apple id and update it to latest firmware.<br />4. FaceID works and that was reassuring<br />5. Screen Quality did not look as impressive as i would have thought from OLED. Need to compare it more. Will update the review.<br />6. However, the battery capacity was at 86% which was concerning since I am sure it will deplete to bare minimum or less than minimum pretty soon. I will update this review and return if things go south soon<br /><br />Amazon Renewed Guarantee: TBD<br />1. I was not aware that there could potentially be a restocking fee if a product is returned. I came across this information thanks to a response from an amazon customer in the Q& A section.<br />2. Though on chat I was reassured by Amazon rep that Amazon would honor or help honor the guarantee within the warranty period.<br />3. So I will update this if i even have to use amazon renewed guarantee. but still this is something to be aware of before making a renewed purchase.<br /><br />Overall, buying an expensive renewed phone can be a dicey affair. Wish there was much better or robust program around renewed phones."

It was said to be in excellent condition I picked it up for about $400. I get the phone, overall it was in good condition. It had one little ding on the bottom right nothing too noticeable. After using it for about 2 days I noticed the battery life was absolutely dreadful. Luckily, the firmware was on 9.3.3 so it could be jailbroken. I jailbroke the iPhone I downloaded a tweak to give me information about my battery life it's at ~40-60% capacity it likes to jump around, it had over 800 charges. The iPhone was used a lot I could tell. So I am going to order an external battery and take apart the phone. Now if anyone else has a bad battery and they need to switch it out I recommend you go with extreme caution. If you're not comfortable with doing it then I highly recommend you don't do it. If you can pay apple their fee (which I think is roughly $100) then I would do that. However, I don't really feel apple should get $100 for a battery you can pick up for $20. But again I am fairly comfortable with taking apart my phone. Overall I am happy about the phone I will update later once I order the battery and get it put in."

I didn't test any other phone functions thus have no comments whether other features are in working order. Since the phone did not perform as described, I had to give it lower rating. But I went with 3 stars since the return process was painless. They provided a prepaid UPS label. I got refund less than 1 week after I shipped it back.

It’s very low, especially on speaker. Can’t have a regular conversation as you can’t hear the person unless you connect headphones which aren’t available to me all the time. When playing music, the sound comes out “tinny” like when your Bluetooth speakers are dying or cheap. Great screen and picture quality though, along with all the other wonderful apps I’ve come to appreciate with apple. I guess there may just be a sound glitch with this particular model as I haven’t had any issues with previous iPhones."

Android haters like to bash on apple for removing the headphone jack adding the notch (which is barely noticeable) but if you look now there are a lot of phones copying the notch from apple? You tell me.<br /><br />I don't like android because it's buggy. Sure it might run well on super expensive phones like pixel 2 or samsung but it still crashes more often than IOS does.<br /><br />I buy apple phones because of the simplicity of the IOS (not that I'm dumb or can't handle android, I build my own gaming computers).

The next best would be the Samsung Galaxy S5.<br /><br />Which iPhone 6 should you buy? That depends on your needs. The iPhone 6+ has bigger screen, better battery life, and better camera (optical image stabilization). But it also comes in a bigger form factor which might be too large for many. It is worth noting that iPhone 6+ is bigger than the LG G3 (iPhone 6+ is thinner), which has the same screen size (5.5 inches) and I think LG G3 is just about the biggest phone that will fit into my pocket. To me, the iPhone 6+ is too big.<br /><br />The iPhone 6 has a 4.7 inch screen which is very functionally useful. I think it could be tad bigger (about 4.8 to 5 inches). In my opinion, the 4.7 inch screen size should be satisfactory to most, especially those who are used to the 4 inch screen size of the iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S. I am used to using Galaxy S5 (5.1 inches) and I don't find the 4.7 inch screen to be too small.<br /><br />So what makes the iPhone 6 so special? It's the form factor (thin and light), the awesome camera, and the touch id (fingerprint sensor).<br /><br />First and foremost, this is a beautiful phone to see and hold. I thought iPhone 5 was beautiful, but the iPhone 6 definitely is better looking! Everyone who has seen my phone in the last 3 days wanted to buy one. The Galaxy S5 is also a thin and beautiful phone. But it is also plastic and has an ugly protruding camera in the back that makes it look like a huge wart. I didn't think I would mind it at first, but the ugliness of the huge square protruding camera really bothered me, especially because, in my view, the S5 camera picture quality was average at best.<br /><br />Second, the camera on the iPhone 6 is just awesome, especially compared to the Galaxy S5. I thought the Galaxy S5 would take better pictures because it is 13 megapixels. Wrong. I have had more blurry pictures with the Galaxy S5 in 4 months than I had with my iPhone 5 in 20 months. Plus, the Galaxy S5 pictures came out very grainy. They looked like they were taken with a smartphone camera. Whereas the pictures taken by the iPhone 6 looked like pictures from a dedicated digital camera. I was especially impressed with its low-light photography and surprisingly powerful flash. Even when taking pictures in low-light, the iPhone 6 camera takes wonderful pictures.<br /><br />Third, the Touch ID (fingerprint sensor) feature is a huge plus for me. I was initially worried that it may take too long to process my fingerprints. Wrong. It takes less than a second to identify my fingerprints. It beats punching my secret code on the screen hands down.<br /><br />The Samsung Galaxy S5, however, still trumps the iPhone 6 in certain areas.<br /><br />The first and foremost is the battery life. Although the iPhone 6 (about 24 hours with normal usage for me) lasts about 20% longer than my iPhone 5, it still can't hold a candle to my Galaxy S5 which can last over 36 hours. If a long battery life is your main need, then I would either get the S5 or get the iPhone 6 with a protective battery case.<br /><br />Second, the Galaxy S5 still has the superior screen. It is not only significantly bigger (5.1 inches), but it is also a full HD (1080p) screen compared to the 720p screen of the iPhone 6. Four months ago, independent tests showed that the Galaxy S5 had the best screen on a smartphone, and I believe it. Seeing them side-by-side, I have to say that I prefer the screen on the Galaxy S5 over the iPhone 6.<br /><br />Lastly, I think the Android platform is well on its way of trouncing Apple in both the number and the variety of apps. Android simply has stronger marketshare and Android programming skills are more widely available. This is especially true if you don't use English as your primary language. If you are looking for apps in Chinese or Spanish, for example, you are more likely to find them in Android than in iPhone.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1)Beautiful form factor. Thin and light. Even the ever-slightly protruding camera looks beautiful<br />2)Awesome camera that takes superior pictures over Android phones such as the Galaxy S5 and Nexus 5. I was especially impressed with the low-light photography.<br />3)Touch ID (fingerprint sensor). It is fast and easy. It makes securing your iPhone 6 very breezy and convenient. I will never use the punching passcodes again.<br />4)Seamless integration of hardware and software that is hard to beat.<br />5)Compatible with most car audio systems. Most Android and Windows phones are not compatible (meaning you can't play music via the USB) with car audio systems. Your Android device can, however, still play music via blutooth if your car audio system supports it. But the music quality is often sub-par.<br />6)Internal storage is much faster than the Micro-SD cards. All iPhone storage are internal, which makes iPhone storage non-expandable but it also enables them to have faster I/O.<br />7)Seamless integration with iTunes. I didn't think this was important until I had to sync my iTunes music with my Android phones. It was a pain.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1)Very average battery life. I still can get 24 hours with normal usage (20 min talk, 20 text, facebook, emails etc.). The lack of battery life is especially apparent when compared to the Galaxy S5, which I can use for little over 36 hours with normal usage.<br />2)Very average screen. The screen size (4.7 inches) was very acceptable. But it is only 720p. Mind you, it is still an excellent screen, but it is also very average by today's smartphone standards.<br />3)Only 1GB of RAM. Most of the top-end Android phones have 2GB or more. The iPhone 6 is a definite laggard in this area. You would need to kill apps (double click on the round button and swipe the apps) on a regular basis to save memory.<br />4)Not waterproof like the Samsung Galaxy S5. I took my Galaxy S5 to outdoor sports and I never had to worry about it getting wet. But I can't do the same with the iPhone 6.<br />5)Many Non-English apps are more widely available in Android than the iPhone.<br />6)Expensive. Android Phones with similar specs would be around $200 lower in price."

I’d have to restart the phone just to talk to someone.  Along with that, when I’m on an app, it randomly opens another app I was previously on, even if I’m not touching the phone.

That being said, I absolutely love the iPhone SE. It's got a classic design, A+ performance, and an excellent battery.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Compact<br />Affordable (For an iPhone)<br />Zippy performance (same CPU and RAM as iPhone 6s)<br />Long lasting battery<br />Charges quickly (about 1.5% per min up to 80% then it slows down)<br />12MP Rear Camera takes crisp, clear shots (and opens very quickly)<br />Has a headphone jack!<br /><br />Meh:<br />Same screen as iPhone 5s (still a crisp, vibrant display, but some will complain about it)<br />Front cam is only 1.3MP (but in my experience it still takes great shots)<br />TouchID is still first gen, so it takes a second to register your print. I like this, however, because it lets me glance at the time before it unlocks.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Small screen (but hey, if you wanted a bigger screen, you wouldn't be looking at this phone)<br />That's it!<br /><br />I use this phone pretty heavily, and I still get a full day of use out of it. Bonus: battery cases for the 5s fit the SE and are relatively cheap (~$25), so if you're a super heavy user, I highly recommend investing in one for even longer battery life! The performance never ceases to amaze me with the A9 chip and 2GB of RAM. Games load quickly and play smoothly, apps switch seamlessly, and nothing ever crashes. It's a silky smooth experience.<br /><br />Seriously, if you're in the market for a smaller phone, get this! It will be supported until at least iOS 11, and probably much longer. And all your iPhone 5/5s cases will still fit! :)"

When the camera is on, there is a strange clicking noise as if an old camcorder was running. Not much of an issue, except the noise persists in video mode as well. So any video taken with the iPhone is disrupted by this noise. Additionally, when trying to zoom on camera or video mode, the screen becomes wavy and out of focus. Therefore no zoom can be used.<br /><br />When contacting BuySPRY about this problem, I was informed I had to pay for the shipping to return the phone in order to get a refund or replacement. When I told them I had moved out of country and it would cost over $100 to ship from New Zealand, I was offered no alternative. Paying this much money because of a faulty item on their end doesn't make any sense and is poor customer service. They also wouldn't be able to send a replacement overseas - only to the original postal address. So I'm stuck with a phone with major camera problems  :/.

Well, this easily tops it.  It’s a way better version.  The screen resolution is great.  Games work really well and load quickly.  Everything is fast really.  I put a Jetech screen protector on mine.  I’m just so impressed of how fast this is.  Touch ID I actually prefer as well.  The battery lasts pretty long for me bc I know how to tweak the settings.

The phone was barely used, inside an office but it was a needed line. A screen protector and cover were installed as the phone was being setup.<br /><br />Over a month of use, the screen started playing games. It would show random patterns or freeze but given that there were updates in between those days, I thought it had to do with updates. However, the issues would continue to happen more and more often and lasting longer so I decided to return, since it was obvious the screen was faulty.<br /><br />CPRTX decided the only thing they needed to return was 72 cents out of the $564 of the phone. Despite being covered by the A to Z Amazon Guarantee, I'm still fighting for my refund - and hope I don't get $565 stolen from them. They keep saying I damaged the phone but their own pictures show a pristine, perfect screen, except when turned on.<br /><br />Otherwise, the iPhone 11 was impeccable. You could tell they did some work by looking at the screws at the bottom but other than that, beautiful. The screen did not seem original but it was working great and so was everything else. You could not believe someone had used that phone before which confirms that there are people out there, like myself, who take really good care of their devices.<br /><br />iOS 14.6 works great in the iPhone 11 and the camera does a better job than the iPhone 6 Plus it replaced. You will also enjoy the added screen size (if you're coming from any of the iPhone Pluses) despite having a smaller device. I do miss TouchID and you will too. Overall, iPhone 11, a great phone. CPRTX - Thieves!<br /><br />So a big warning. Do not trust this (CPRTX) seller. They will do everything in their power to steal from you and do not care if the ship to you a faulty phone. They feel Amazon backs them up. I will update if something new happens."

Enjoy the classically sleek design of the iPhone SE in black at a great price from Tracfone. Activate today & enjoy Unbeatable nationwide coverage™ on America’s largest and most dependable networks.'],,4.0,Tracfone and Apple products: great and frustrating!,"FALSE ADVERTISING:<br />Please note that you will not receive the 12GB bonus card with this purchase. For $289, you will receive only a new 2nd generation iPhone SE (black), SIM card, and lightning charging cord (no USB wall charger). I'm not sure if this is on the 4G or 5G network.<br /><br />I had the 1st generation iPhone SE Tracfone 3G (2016) so it made sense for me to upgrade to the 2nd generation iPhone SE Tracfone (2020). I was anticipating an easy transition and it definitely was easy. For those that are not tech savvy, the steps are simple, especially if you currently have an iPhone Tracfone.<br /><br />Step 1: Turn on (and plug in to charge) new Iphone and keep old iphone on<br />Step 2: Your old iPhone will recognize a new iPhone is near and will ask if you want to transfer the data from the old iPhone to the new iPhone. Follow the instructions to transfer the data to the new phone.<br />Step 3: The new iPhone will receive the transferred data and also update the iOS software to iOS 15.4.1 (this took me about 20 minutes)<br />Step 4: While I waited for the new iPhone to update software and data transfer, I logged onto Tracfone.com and selected the ACTIVATE tab, entered my existing Tracfone phone number and entered the Serial number (also known as IMEI, MEID or ESN) for the new iPhone and initiated the activation<br />Step 5: After the new iPhone software downloaded and data transfer finished, I turned off the new iphone and put in the SIM card (that I just activated on the Tracfone website), then turned the new iPhone back on<br />Step 6: Within less than 5 minutes, the new iphone was already working immediately with my existing Tracfone number; my existing phone number and existing pool of Tracfone minutes, texts and data all transferred over<br /><br />The CONS:<br />I am not able to access the Tracfone website on any Apple Mac or my iPhone. I keep getting an ""Access Denied Error 15"" message. The Tracfone app from the Apple App Store is also worthless. I have to use a PC computer in order to activate my Tracfone or view my balance. The work around to checking my balance is texting the word ""balance"" to 611611 and the work around to activate the new iPhone SIM card is by calling Tracfone's toll free number. I'm the type of person that likes to do things without talking to a customer service rep which is why these two failures are huge CONS for me.<br /><br />Overall I still like Tracfone because I do not have to pay any monthly fees. I am never able to spend my pool of minutes/texts/data so it repeatedly rolls over year after year as long as I remember to keep my account active before it expires."

Apple iPhone 7 Unlocked Phone 32GB - US Version (Rose Gold),"['The latest iPhone with advanced camera, better battery life, immersive speakers and water resistance!']",,2.0,Losing love from early adopters ...,"I have owned an iPhone 3G, two iPhone 4, one 4S and three iPhone 6s. We also had iPads (from iPad 2 to Air 2). I am quite dissapointed with Apple's recent changes both to iOS and the product lines.<br /><br />The iPhone's ORIGINAL most important feature was that it could host you music. I use my phone for calls almost the entire day. I listen to music and take calls in mu phone and comouter all the time.<br /><br />This means bluetooth is not good. I don't need the radiation, the constant recharging baby sitting, and the cumbersome dongle to charge the phone while using a wired headset. I also have a car without bluetooth, that has an rj plug. The best quality is using the jack. This is a high end stereo speaker, and I have tried bluetooth adapters, and it sounds really awful.<br /><br />My famility has had to replace broken glasses so many times too. The more they make it fancy, the easiest to get them to crack. Since everything is getting integrated, a glass crack means replacing a very expensive screen now (this started with 6S line).<br /><br />I will skip iPhone 7, and have already had my wife tell me she doesn't want it either.<br /><br />I can't rate this phone more than 2 stars. The iPhone 6S gets 3 (due to the screen), the 4S would get 5 (but it's too slow now) and this last phone gets a 2: a hassle to me, overpriced, and requires extra insurance (screen) while being to fragile and thin making the battery small so it can't last me a single day, making the thin phone turn into clumsy one that needs a case.<br /><br />Apple can build products, and make decisions. I can skip those products. But when you make an ecosystem, where switching is very hard, and start taking away choices without consulting, you are abusing your user base.<br /><br />Is this a bad phone? No. But it's much worst than 6S to me, and its predecessors. And compared to them, it's a 3, and one star is taking by the horrendous cross sell that is happening in the AppStore (i don't care one bit iPhone App has an iWatch App, stop telling me: you already know I have no iEatch registered with you). They are also responsible for bringing casinos into into childs lives and those that can't refrain, through the In App purchase model. I am discouting 1 star for that, and retroactively to all other phones as well.<br /><br />The iPhone is still my prefered choice. But I am odds with how its features are evolving in ways that I don't like, and make it an inferior product overall."

And I didn’t want to spend another $1000 on a new iPhone at the moment because personally the 11 Pro really doesn’t fit the criteria for the next iPhone I want to call my daily driver. That’s where this iPhone X comes into play. I wanted the same thing I had but, just works and is not broken. This iPhone is in spectacular condition. Whoever the previous owner was took EXTREME care of it. I don’t even see a scratch on the body. But not everything is bells and whistles. This iPhone’s telephoto lens is kinda messed up. It’s not visibly cracked but there might be a problem with the iris. I could live with that because to be honest I don’t take portrait mode or zoomed photos often anyways. But here’s where my gripe is. The Digitizer. The screen has random touches in this one spot and it’s kind of bugging me. The first 2 days I didn’t even see this at all. It was functional and well. But it started having this problem. This would’ve have been a 4 star review had the screen worked properly."

The ear speaker on this phone does not work. I can turn the phone on speaker phone and make a phone call but when you try and take it off speakerphone all you hear is garbled voices and a lot of static. You can understand about every 10th word.

When  I hit the side button to try and shut the sound off the screen went black and it still was making this weird high-pitched sound that ended up stopping after about 30-45 seconds very annoying. I finally had to shut the phone completely off and turn it back on at which point I was able to make a call on speakerphone. I’ve never had problems like this with a refurbished phone! After doing a chat with Amazon they told me I had to handle it with the seller who is supposed to be calling me to provide me with a prepaid label to return it and to discuss a replacement phone. The return policy says I have to return the phone to them and then they have two weeks to give me a refund on my money so that it will be another two weeks before a order a different phone.<br /><br />I just want to say that after I finally received a call from them my refund was processed very promptly.

Quality Controlled. 70-point inspection.<br />All indicators that you better insure any and every product purchased under the brand BuySpry because as the name suggests it will break quickly. Hopefully you are one of the lucky ones that buy second hand and receives a product that functions and lasts. You have no assurance or guarantee, just a wish. Be very careful within initial return period (most often 30 days) as any even small issue needs to be addressed. That issue, whatever it may be will prove fatal in due time. It is almost as if devices are programmed to break after 30 days. In my personal case, the iPhone I purchased after a week of normal use suffered critical issue. Customer service did not respond to the most recent message from me via email. After speaking to them on phone they stated resolution would be a refund. Do you have a back up device? I hope so. In the lucky case of an exchange (which I pushed for) brace yourself for longer than promised times to receive new product. There is a chance this turns into groundhog day but I hope you receive a working product that endures.<br />Overall enterprise and business solution, would be to place more in reserves for replacement and increase service ability to send new product with promissory of receiving broken product. Filling this void, keeping customers whole while resolving issue. Leaving customers a loaner device would increase their reputation, making them the tallest in a room of short people but hey, you would purchase with confidence under that premise right?

They advised me that they were trying to activate the phone but, kept running into multiple error issues with the SIM and phone ID. They input new SIM's, etc. The representative got the phone to activate for a minimum of about 7 minutes total. After activating the rep tried to make a call to verify that the phone operated and the phone dial tone gave an error message of  ""blocked from network use"". The at&t representative and a manager messed with it multiple times and could not get it to work. The supervisor at that point advised us that AT&T along with all the other cellular companies monitor SIM cards and phone ID's for stolen or lost traffic. This phone was apparently reported stolen according to the phone ID. She stated they would not activate it, refused to give the phone back to me until I called the cops, and filled out a report.

I have had a 5, 6s plus, and now, the 7. When I got so mad at the poor functionality of the 6, and after smashing and breaking it, i got the 7, thinking it was a superior phone. Well, compared even to the 6, and the horrible LG line up that they've had their entire time as a smart phone manufacturer, the 7 is literally a pile of garbage.<br /><br />Here is what is right with it:<br />- The camera. It works. The 6 was better.<br /><br />That's it. Here's what's wrong with it:<br />- Freezes randomly in the middle of a task<br />- Randomly closes me out of apps<br />- Not smooth, fluid functionality<br />- Voice to text is laughably worse than Android. Before the latest iOS update, that was one of the only things I preferred about the iPhone over an Android. Now, apple has nothing.<br />- Maps is a joke<br />- The home button is also a joke. In order to do a reset, you have to hold the power and volume down key, which in turn turns your volume down. Because that couldn't be programmed to operate differently.<br />- Who needs a headphone jack? Not the 7, apparently. Now you have to buy a separate $25 piece to listen to music.<br />- Overall cheap feel.<br />- Autocorrect. What? You typed &#34;of&#34;? You obviously meant &#34;if&#34;.<br /><br />I could go on and on about how terrible this phone is. But, I think you get it. I have put in a request at work to get back into a 6, because of how terrible this phone is. Out of the nearly two dozen phones I've owned over my lifetime, this stands at my number one spot for worst phone available to major providers over the last 15 years. I have also been to the three major providers (Tmobile, att, and Verizon), and have had a huge array of different kinds of phones. I say with confidence, that this is the worst phone I have ever had the stress, and displeasure of using.<br /><br />Buy at your own risk. These phones are terrible."

The iphone system is very efficient at the cost of a few extra features compared to android flagship smartphones. But, that helps it be more reliable and smooth. The iPhone 6 is a beautiful handset but suffers from a very thin and weak Aluminum frame which allowed for relatively easy damage/bending. Apple got enough complaints apparently that they upgraded their iPhone 6S and 6S Plus with a new and stronger frame alloy that's also a little thicker...iPhone 6S is still made of Aluminum but with a higher concentration of Zinc which adds alot of strength to it (7000 series Aluminum) a popular Youtube channel called unboxed theraphy had the iPhone 6S case elements tested at a special metalurgy company and confirmed a stronger alloy. He also tested the iPhone 6 vs iPhone 6S on a machine that measured exact pressure placed on each phone separately. The iPhone 6 resisted 30 lbs of force before starting to bend/flex. In contrast, the iPhone 6S resisted 80 lbs before starting to bend, that's 2.5X stronger. It's already known te iPhones are some of the best smartphones but with these gindings it made me feel much more comfortable upgrading one of my lines to the iPhone 6S Instead of the 6. Add to that the extra features, faster processor and now confirmed 2gb of Ram and the iPhone 6S is the much better pick.
