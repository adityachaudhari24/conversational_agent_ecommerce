It's known for its impressive photo quality, making it one of the best iterations of iPhones for photography. You can find it for **$264.00** as a renewed option.\n\nIf you're considering other options, the **Apple iPhone 6s Plus** also has a strong camera performance and is rated **5.0**. However, I don't have the price for that model. \n\nOverall, both of these iPhones are great for capturing high-quality photos!",
